Business custom status:
Custom status refers to the ability to create and define personalized labels or descriptions for different stages or states of a process within a system or application. It allows users to tailor the status names and descriptions to better align with their specific business needs, branding, and customer communication.

In the context of products, customers, and orders, custom status allows businesses to define unique labels for various stages of an order's lifecycle. For example, instead of using generic status labels like "processing" or "shipped," businesses can create custom statuses such as "Order Confirmed," "Ready for Dispatch," or "Out for Delivery." These custom status names can be more descriptive and reflective of the company's branding, enhancing the overall customer experience.
