In today's fast-paced world, time management is crucial. Whether it's for personal or professional tasks, keeping track of the time spent on each task is essential to increase productivity and efficiency. This is where "Tracker 23" comes in, a time tracing tool developed by JS-SBU unit of Brain Station 23 Ltd.

Tracker 23 is designed to help users track their time spent on different projects and meetings. It can sync with Jira and Trello, allowing users to import projects and tasks assigned to them. For each task, users can start a timer manually to track the time spent on a specific task, just like the popular Toggle time tracker tool. If they need to switch tasks, they can stop the timer and restart it when they start working again, allowing multiple sessions for each task.

The best part is that users can send the spent time of each task to Jira or Trello project management tools automatically or manually, depending on their preferences. This means users have complete control over their tracked time and can manage them directly from the settings options.

Moreover, Tracker 23 has a dashboard that provides users with an overview of all their tasks' status, including estimation time, spent time, progress percentage, and more, project-wise, with graphical representation. This feature allows users to visualize their progress and identify areas for improvement.

The app also has the ability to export reports in excel or csv format, making it easier to share data with others or to analyze it further. This feature is especially helpful for project managers who need to keep track of their team's progress and productivity.

Tracker 23 is developed by JS-SBU unit of Brain Station 23 Ltd. The platform leverages the power of JavaScript technologies, making it fast and efficient. With its integration with popular project management tools like Jira and Trello, users can easily import their projects and tasks into Tracker 23, saving them time and effort.
